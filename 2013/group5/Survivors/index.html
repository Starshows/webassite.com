				<p>
					"We are here to stay," the Baris said as they stood next to their globally renowned manufactured pizza ovens on sale at their main showroom at 240 Bowery. The Bari Restaurant and Pizzeria Equipment store, located at Prince Street and the Bowery, is one of the dozens of restaurant supply businesses in the area. Founded in the 1940's by Anton Mayer's great grandfather, Nicola Bari, the Bari business has stood the test of time and survived the recent redevelopments pressures on the Bowery.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Bari family owns their stores, a fact which has permitted them to keep their business running without having to deal with the raising rents, which currently affect many Bowery merchants.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					"If you look outside today, it is one of the most desirable places in New York City, which was not the case 20 years ago," said Anton, when "there were bums and drunks in the corners and nobody wanted to walk through here." As Anton continues to narrate the Bari family history - his uncles and cousins enthusiastically greet incoming customers with great hospitality - a quality that has set their business apart for decades.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Bari family used to own The Sunshine Hotel, one of the last single room occupancy hotels that used to exist in New York's skid row. However, the Baris sold the building in recent years - due to increased property taxes - and since, the ground floor has been converted into a diner and an art gallery.
				</p>	
				<br>
				<p>
					In 2004, cousin Mike Bari told the Times about the meaning of The Bowery: "It's not a street. It's not a road. It's not a boulevard...it's just the Bowery." (New York Times, July 25 2004).
