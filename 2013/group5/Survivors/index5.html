				The current redevelopment pressures on the Bowery have resulted in displacement of many residents and business-owners. <br>The ones left have great stories to tell and give hope to what the future holds for The Bowery.</p>

					<p>
						"We are here to stay," the Baris said as they stood next to their globally renowned manufactured pizza ovens on sale at their main showroom at 240 Bowery. The Bari Restaurant and Pizzeria Equipment store, located at Prince Street and the Bowery, is one of the dozens of restaurant supply businesses in the area. Founded in the 1940's by Anton Mayer's great grandfather, Nicola Bari, the Bari business has stood the test of time and survived the recent redevelopments pressures on the Bowery.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The Bari family owns their stores, a fact which has permitted them to keep their business running without having to deal with the raising rents, which currently affect many Bowery merchants.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						"If you look outside today, it is one of the most desirable places in New York City, which was not the case 20 years ago," said Anton, when "there were bums and drunks in the corners and nobody wanted to walk through here." As Anton continues to narrate the Bari family history - his uncles and cousins enthusiastically greet incoming customers with great hospitality - a quality that has set their business apart for decades.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The Bari family used to own The Sunshine Hotel, one of the last single room occupancy hotels that used to exist in New York's skid row. However, the Baris sold the building in recent years - due to increased property taxes - and since, the ground floor has been converted into a diner and an art gallery.
					</p>	
					<br>
					<p>
						In 2004, cousin Mike Bari told the Times about the meaning of The Bowery: "It's not a street. It's not a road. It's not a boulevard...it's just the Bowery." (New York Times, July 25 2004).

							Lighting by Gregory, a new york retail landmark for lighting fixtures, has been around for almost four decades and seems to be growing steadily, while other less fortunate businesses on the Bowery are fading out slowly. According to Silverstein, Vice-president of Sales - who has been working in the store since his teenage years - the Bowery "has gentrified and the property values have increased tremendously". 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							He reminisces of a time when the street was inhabited by homeless people, everyone knew each other and traditional retailing was the only way to shop for your lighting needs. Currently, Lighting by Gregory have put great effort to acquire a strong international web-based clientele, in order to adapt to the changing global economy, which has given the store a competitive advantage over the others.  "Customers are often doing their online shopping first", says Silverstein, "nobody walks in here on weekends without a print out from the internet". However, they still come to the showroom to feel and touch their options and talk to the highly trained staff.  "Human beings are always better than a computer", Silverstein adds. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The quaint-looking facade fools the average passerby, Lighting by Gregory's client list ranges from Yoko Ono to the Harry Winston store. Many Woody Allen films have featured lighting fixtures from Lighting by Gregory, proving once more the store's strong presence amongst New Yorker clientele. For Silverstein, "the future looks good" and sees the area continuing to develop vertically. However, after discussing for a while the upcoming developments on the Bowery, a hint of nostalgia seems to take over him, when he concludes by saying: "I do miss the old days!".

						<p>
							In a city where one in every 215 New Yorkers is currently homeless, places like The Bowery Mission are essential to address the needs of thousands of men, women and children that roam the city every day. For many homeless new Yorkers, the prominent red doors at 227 Bowery are the answer to their prayers. The Bowery Mission helps the homeless by meeting immediate needs, such as: foods, shelter, clothing and medical care.  In addition, they offer in-house recovery programs that address the complexity of homelessness, addressing the persons deeper needs: spiritual wholeness, life and job skills training and addiction recovery.  
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Many dedicated volunteers -mostly Bowery residents - give their time and effort to help transform the lives of destitute people in the city by creating strong community networks of support. According to the Mission's website: "each meal served represents an opportunity to connect with a person to understand his or her needs and provide them with healing and hope". If one arrives at The Bowery Mission's scheduled meal hours, there is no doubt of the wonderful work that this mission has taken on.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The Bowery Mission has proven they are here to stay and here to change. Their work has reshaped the history of the homeless in the Bowery, famously known as 'skid row' and the dwelling place for most destitute New Yorkers. Although, one might argue that the real survivors are the countless men, women and children who have overcome or are currently overcoming poverty and homelessness in the city.

						<p>
							Sometimes architecture is the only survivor on the Bowery, as places adapt and transform into other uses and new owners.This is the case of the Bowery Savings Bank, a New York City landmark designed by Stanford White, from the renowned firm McKim, Mead and White. Currently, it is known as "Capitale", one of New York City's most coveted venues, with 40,000 square feet of multi-level event rooms and luxurious Beaux-Arts interiors. Adorned with Corinthian columns, Venetian glass, marble mosaic floors and 65-foot ceilings - Capitale seems to attract the most selective clientele.  
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							However, the reality inside is far from what it was a century ago. Inside the Bank's vaults, the gold has been exchanged with champagne and wine bottles, and as you pass through the kitchens you can smell the most heavenly desserts and appetizers being prepared for the night's soiree. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Nowadays, many Bowery residents still remember with melancholy going to the Bank as a child to deposit money. The insertion of "Capitale" in the community has not made the local residents content. Many still worry that it might accelerate the gentrification process in the Bowery; as well as mark the beginning of the exclusion of the local community within the new developments. Mike, a local resident, argues that the inclusion of a restaurant and event space in a landmarked building, is due to the lack of creativity of developers – "not every Bank needs to be redeveloped as an event space…we need new ideas of how to retrofit these spaces and integrate them into the city".

							The four-story red-brick building at 340 Bowery, has been around for almost a century. It is the last of many single-room occupancy hotels or "flophouses" that could be found in the Bowery.  
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Euzebius Ghelardi opened the White House in 1917 as a lodging house. In 1998, Meyer Muschel, a Columbia Law School graduate bought the property, with 195 permanent indigent tenants still lodged in the White House. A couple of years later, Mr. Muschel opened up the cubicles to young tourists and visiting students as well. Beds went for $28 per night. Twenty years later, The Whitehouse Hotel still offers single rooms for only $30 a night for travelers and young students. The revenue from the tourists that visit in the summer and holiday season subsidizes the permanent residents that are paying $10 a night. The number of permanent dwellers has decreased in the past years. However, they are still there, which is hard to say for other disappearing flophouses on the Bowery.

							Straight across from the White House is The Bowery Hotel, charging up to $400 for a room. How long can the White House resist the current redevelopment pressures? Hopefully, Mr. Muschel's alternative hostel model can continue generating revenue, so that this Bowery Survivor keeps lodging low-income tenants and young visitors for decades to come.

							As you walk on the Bowery towards Spring Street, you might notice an old intriguing grafitti-covered building and begin to wander: "Why haven't developers found this Bowery gem?"  
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							This would be the old Germania Bank - dating back to 1898 - designed by German-born architect Robert Maynicke. The Bank later changed its name to the Commonwealth Bank, due to the anti-German sentiment raging after World War I. It finally closed its doors in the mid-1960's.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							It was 1966, when photographer Jay Maisel was looking for cheap space to work and live. He turned to the Bowery for large amounts of space where he could produce his art, and was offered the abandoned Germania Bank. However, vast space never comes cheap in New York City, this time it came with a doorstep covered with "every single thing that can come out of a human body" (nymag.com, 2008).  He purchased the building for US$102,000 and against all odds moved into the abandoned bank. The building is preserved almost intact to the 1898 design, and became an official city landmark in 2005.   
						</p>
						<p>
							Maisel uses the first three floors as gallery space and the fourth floor,  a transitional space, was once rented out to Roy Lichtenstein. The fifth floor became a workshop space and Jay's family inhabits the sixth floor. Jay, his wife Linda and daughter Amanda have survived in the ever-changing Bowery, but have started to rent out the first floor for commercial uses. In 2008, the 35,000 square-foot home was valued at around US$50 million.
