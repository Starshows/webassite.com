      SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
      Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
      COUNTESS
      In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
      BERTRAM
      And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
      anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
      whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
      LAFEU
      You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
      sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
      good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
      worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
      than lack it where there is such abundance.
      COUNTESS
      What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
      LAFEU
      He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
      practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
      finds no other advantage in the process but only the
      losing of hope by time.
